### Heart beat. Optical Measuring
- The light from the light source (fig.a) is absorbed by tissue, venous blood and arterial blood.
- The light absorption is in proportion to arterial blood volume (fig.b).
- The output of the light detector shows the blood volume changes synchronized with heart beats (fig.c).
- Usually, the measured AC component is named by pulse wave or PPG (Photo Plethysmo Gram).
